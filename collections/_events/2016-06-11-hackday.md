## About the Hackday

This is the second Typelevel hack day in conjunction with the [London Scala User Group](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/) and [Hack The Tower](http://hackthetower.co.uk/).

Join users of and contributors to [Typelevel projects](/projects) and [Typelevel Scala](https://github.com/typelevel/scala) and learn how to put them to good use in your own projects and how to make them better for the whole Scala community!

At the [May Typelevel hack day](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/230514810/) we had people working on the Scala compiler (we submitted a pull request against 2.12.x which as been accepted and merged!), people exploring Cats and shapeless, people working on Ensime and FreeSlick and people working through introductory Scala problems and exercises ... something for everyone whatever their level of expertise.

Please come and join us, and if there's anything you'd like to chat about beforehand head over to the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/hack-the-tower).
