## About the Hackday

This is the sixth Typelevel hack day in conjunction with the [London Scala User Group](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/) and [Hack The Tower](http://hackthetower.co.uk/).

Join users of and contributors to [Typelevel projects](/projects) and [Typelevel Scala](https://github.com/typelevel/scala) and learn how to put them to good use in your own projects and how to make them better for the whole Scala community!

At the [August Typelevel hack day](http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/232890867/) we had people working on the Scala compiler, SBT and Ensime, and experimenting with using Scala.Meta to preprocess Scala source code!

Please come and join us, and if there's anything you'd like to chat about beforehand head over to the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/typelevel/hack-the-tower).
